# Embracing Sphere: Auditory Environmental Storytelling with Audio-Tactile Playback Systems
## Abstract
Conveying a story through environment is a known technique in multiple mediums. Blood stain under the door, footstep trails on snow and broken chain next to a beware dog sign; all those scene descriptions are an example for environmental storytelling. Utilizing multi-modal stimuli for enhancing environmental storytelling remains open for new experiments through the environment.

To explore possibilities beyond these limitations, this research explores the integration of haptic feedback and acoustic modeling methods. 

This applied work master’s thesis will investigate the current state and the potential of such multi-modal experiences in conveying environmental information and narrative, aiming to investigate capabilities of auditory environmental snapshots for narrative purposes.
# Introduction
Virtual environments as narrative spaces, represents a novel way to tell a story or convey a specific feeling to the audience. Unlike traditional storytelling methods that rely on delivering story through dialogue, cutscenes or text dumps; environmental storytelling operates more subtly. 

Due to exploratory and emergent capabilities of video games, environmental storytelling practiced more often in video games. With increasing practice, the auditory domain of environmental storytelling remains understudied. 

The aim is to explore how audio-tactile experiences can enhance immersion, evoke emotional responses with more embodied narrative contents for the audience.
# Research Questions
The study addresses the following three fundamental questions about auditory environmental storytelling:
1. To what extent does multi-modality play a role in the environmental storytelling?
2. How multi-modal stimulation can be utilized on auditory environmental storytelling?
3. How effectively can an interactive audio-tactile system convey environmental characteristics and narrative cues?
# Multi-Modality
The term "modality" is studied across diverse disciplines such as linguistics, media studies, semiotics and cognitive science. Each examining different aspects of representation, communication or interaction. This thesis uses modality term to refer to sensory channels auditory and tactile feedback.

Sensory modalities such as auditory cues can convey ambient information and shape emotional tone, while the somatosensory system(the system responsible for our touch perception[[References#Neuroscience. 2nd edition.|4]].) offers a direct physical link to digital environments, enhancing feelings of presence and embodiment.
# Environment as a Tool for Storytelling
Virtual spaces in interactive mediums are the environments where the story unfolds and where the audience actively participates. Environmental storytelling promotes virtual environments role from basic background to an active narrative agent[[References#Interactive Narratives and Transmedia Storytelling|5]].

# Acoustic Modeling
For auditory side of proposed artwork acoustic modeling techniques utilized. This acoustic modeling uses room impulse responses(RIRs) to simulate sound propagation. An anechoic sound is convolved with an RIR and this mathematical process applies the room's acoustic snapshot to the sound. The convolution effectively embeds the reflections and reverberation captured in the RIR to the original sound.
# Haptics
Haptic feedback refers to the sense of touch. The haptic system uses sensory information derived from mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin, muscles, tendons and joints[[References#Haptic Perception|7]].

Other forms of haptic interaction, such as thermal feedback and electrovibration are outside the scope of this study thus a vibrotactile device chosen for this research purpose.  These vibrotactile devices are similar to those of loudspeakers and voice coil actuators[[References#Audio-Tactile Rendering|8]], allowing for conventional audio recording practices viable on haptic feedback content creation.
