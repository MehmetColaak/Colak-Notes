De Anima: 
1. Nutritive Soul (Vegetative Soul): This is the most basic level of soul, possessed by all living things, including plants. It is responsible for growth, nutrition, and reproduction. The nutritive soul allows organisms to maintain their life and produce offspring, but it doesn’t involve perception or thought.
    
2. **Sensitive Soul (Animal Soul)**: On top of the nutritive capabilities, animals have a sensitive soul, which adds the capacities for sensation, desire, pain, pleasure, and movement. This type of soul allows animals to interact with their environment in more complex ways than plants, responding to stimuli, moving towards or away from things, and experiencing sensations.
    
3. **Rational Soul (Human Soul)**: Humans possess the rational soul, which includes all the functions of the nutritive and sensitive souls but also adds the capacity for reason. The rational soul enables abstract thought, deliberation, decision-making, and the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. According to Aristotle, this aspect of the soul is what distinguishes humans from other forms of life.

the complex relationships between creators and their creation.
