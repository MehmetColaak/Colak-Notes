## Feminist AI and Data Processing

To understand feminist approach to ai, data collection and data processing, we need to digest couple key points and problems built in our social lives. By my research evaluating AI technology with feminist approaches is listed as that;
### Acknowledging Power

Recognizing that data is never neutral but shaped by who collects it, how it's categorized, and what questions are deemed worth studying. This means examining whose perspectives are centered or marginalized in data collection and analysis.

### Intersectional Analysis

Considering how multiple forms of identity and power structures intersect in data, rather than treating categories like gender as simple binaries. This includes analyzing how data systems might reinforce or challenge existing inequalities.

### Ethics in Data Practices

Prioritizing responsibility toward communities being studied, considering impacts of data collection and use, and ensuring benefits flow back to participants. This includes practices like:

- Obtaining meaningful informed consent
- Protecting privacy and security of vulnerable populations
- Giving communities agency over their own data
- Considering long-term impacts beyond immediate research goals

### Critical Examination of Categories

Questioning how demographic categories and variables are defined, who defines them, and what assumptions they encode. This includes being thoughtful about:

- How gender and sex are recorded and analyzed
- Whether binary categories reflect lived experiences
- What other important dimensions of identity might be missing

### Transparency About Limitations

Being explicit about gaps, biases and assumptions in datasets rather than claiming objectivity. This includes documenting:

- Who is missing from the data
- What questions weren't asked
- How collection methods might have shaped responses

The artwork I want to highlight about this topic is WordOfMathBias from Memo Akten. His exploration of math bias through art is a critique of how algorithms and data systems, often seen as objective, are imbued with human bias. His work often visualizes complex systems and datasets, unraveling the ways they reflect societal prejudices, historical inequalities, and cultural assumptions.

He developed a twitter bot that performs random mathematical operations on random words and tweets the results. It first picks 2 to 4 completely random words from a vocabulary of 100K words then performs random arithmetic operations (addition or subtraction) on these vectors. 

This results in a new location in the high dimensional space. The bot then returns the closest words.
