## Reflection on Data Science as Machinic Neoplatonism

As I read through the Dan McQuillan’s critique I started to understand the mechanisms of knowledge synthesis of our current scientific culture. Focused on how data science and machine learning concepts can disrupt and even relocate this whole structure of this knowledge and decision making mechanisms with biased and unbacktrackable concepts.

While Dan McQuillan was pointing some problems about data science and evaluation from an amalgamation of different entry values I remembered a Philip K. Dick story that has used that problems and concepts as a main plot in the story. The story “Minority Report” is built on the idea that the future can be predicted, and murders can be prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. McQuillan views this as a problem because of the potential is created for discrimination that evades due process.

McQuillan points out that data science today often relies on hidden, complex systems. This goes beyond individual apps—it’s even seen in broader ideas from Silicon Valley, like using algorithms to solve social issues as if they were technical glitches. The statement about the NSA shows how powerful metadata alone can be for surveillance, making content almost irrelevant. The takeaway here is that data science is evolving into a kind of automated philosophy—a "machinic neo-platonism.”

“Metadata alone is so powerful for surveillance that the NSA don’t care about the actual content of our messages (Opsahl 2013)” which are quite remarkable for todays data collection and our data usage for this problematic purposes. The semi conclusion given for these notions can be summed up by saying that data science is, or is becoming, an automated form of applied philosophy; a machinic neo-platonism.

In our scientific culture, these ideas are seen as powerful truths. Data science lets us view society as a set of data points that can be measured and controlled. This creates not only specific problems, like unfair treatment from biased algorithms, but also a broader issue of "epistemic injustice." In this view, data science has more authority than individual perspectives or communities who may lack the means to challenge it.

The core idea is summed up like this, “With data science we have moved from metadata to metaphysics; it is an embedded, even weaponized, philosophy. Where humans are part of the data science apparatus, what can be said about the effect on human agency of data science as an organizing idea?”

With these statements McQuillans propose a counterculture of Data science. I myself want to expand this approach to all generative data oriented evaluations because the scope of data science and effect in our life is also expanding day by day.

Data science shapes our view of the world, almost like a guiding force within science itself. To push back, a counterculture needs more than just new ideas; it needs a fresh way of using the tools and insights data science provides. Instead of just rejecting data science, a meaningful counterculture would reshape its methods to support a more open, participatory way of understanding reality one that values diverse perspectives and shared control.
