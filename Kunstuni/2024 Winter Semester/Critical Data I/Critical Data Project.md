## Music Bias in AI
Music genres like Turkish Maqam Music is microtonal thus it doesn't have equal temperament scale.

Western music theory uses terminology like harmony/inharmony and consonant/dissonant which these adjectives doesn't always represents the same sense in ethnomusicologic context.

Generative Adversarial Networks uses similar kind of approach like visual generation when it comes to generating audio files. Thats why learned data, categorization and supervised learning practices by people can inject inevitable bias into a model.

I want to research biases on ai generated music with ethnic cultures and minorities.
