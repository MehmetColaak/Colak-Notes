### Embracing Sphere: Auditory Environmental Narration with Audio-Tactile Playback Systems
## Topic
Conveying a narrative through environment is a known technique in multiple media domains. Heavy reliance on visual cues, static soundscapes and easy grasp interfaces defines the limitations of current methods in environmental storytelling. Utilizing multi-modal stimuli and 3D audio volumes for enhancing environmental narration remains niche and open for new perspectives in storytelling and narration through the environment. 

To explore possibilities beyond these limitations, this research explores the integration of haptic feedback and advanced acoustic modeling methods. Haptic feedback systems mostly used by video games, racing simulations and interactive art installations, are often fed by low frequency audio signals to create pulses on haptic actuators. Complementing tactile channel, Room Impulse Response (RIR) is a method is a method of capturing acoustic properties of an enclosed volume/space later to use in reverberation(specifically convolution reverbs) to reconstruct the same acoustic responses while simulating different materials. Combining these distinct modalities like tactile pulses and acoustic reconstruction offers novel ways to represent environmental snapshots purely through non-visual interfaces.

Building on this potential, a multi-modal stimulation scenario using simultaneous audio signal playback driven by a speaker array incorporating procedurally generated RIRs and a bass shaker (transducer) will be this thesis's foundational method for creating artificial environments and allowing the audience to perceive the world.

This applied work masterâ€™s thesis will investigate the current state and the potential of such multi-modal experiences in conveying environmental information and narrative, aiming to design, implement and evaluate an interactive audio-tactile system capable of procedurally generating environmental snapshots for narrative purposes.

## Structure
#### Introduction

Hook: Start with the potential of multi-sensory experiences (specifically audio-tactile) in conveying environmental information and narrative.
    
- Problem Statement: Clearly define the limitations of current methods in environmental storytelling (e.g., reliance on visual cues, static soundscapes, lack of integrated haptics). Highlight the challenge of representing dynamic environmental characteristics (space, material) interactively.
    
- Research Question(s): Formulate precise questions your thesis aims to answer. Examples:
    
	- How can procedurally generated Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) and corresponding haptic feedback be combined to create dynamic "Acoustic and Haptic Snapshots" for environmental narration?
	- What are effective design principles for an interactive system that generates and plays back these multimodal snapshots?
	- How does the integration of audio and tactile feedback influence the perception and interpretation of environmental narratives in an interactive art context?
	
- Project Goal/Aim: State clearly what your project sets out to achieve (e.g., "To design, implement, and evaluate an interactive audio-tactile system capable of procedurally generating environmental snapshots for narrative purposes").
    
- Contribution: Briefly outline the novelty of your work (e.g., the specific procedural generation method, the integration approach, the application to narrative via an art installation).
    
- Scope and Limitations: Define the boundaries of your research (e.g., types of environments modeled, specific haptic modalities used, complexity of the narrative, scale of the user evaluation if any).
    

Thesis Outline: Briefly state what each subsequent chapter will cover.
