### Accepting Acoustics in Creative Practices: Conservatism and Stigmatization in the Adoption of Sonic Interfaces 
## Topic
Research is about how assistive technologies(in this thesis scope, sonic interfaces and acoustic technologies) are initially linked to disabled people by non-disabled individuals. It focuses on "Why assistive technologies often first gain traction within disabled communities?". First and easy answer is due to their immediate and obvious benefits, but there should be other social behaviours under the rug like conservatism and stigmatization.

Non-disabled individuals may practice conservatism in adopting assistive technologies, partly due to a lack of perceived immediate need or benefit. This conservative approach can slow the integration of such technologies into broader society until their utility is demonstrated in diverse contexts beyond disability support.

The thesis aims to question and fill these existing gaps by using acoustic technologies and sonic interfaces in artistic contexts. Generative and procedural methods is going to get involved to synthesize room impulse responses based on interactive acoustic parameters, enabling artists to craft unique acoustic environments. By exploring generative technologies, the thesis will frame the feasibility and artistic value of using sonic interfaces in creative practices.

To explore these social behaviours, the thesis will use a questionnaire after presenting sound art created with the technologies mentioned before. The survey will gather feedback from both disabled and non-disabled users to compare 2 different views and experiences. This will help reveal how these technologies are perceived, any barriers or biases to their adoption, and the overall acceptance of assistive technologies.
