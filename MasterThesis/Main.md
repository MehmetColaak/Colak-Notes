### Embracing Sphere: A Critical Approach to the Adoption of Immersive Audio Technologies in Sound Art
## Topic
Immersive audio technologies, such as ambisonics and HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function), aim to replicate spatial soundscapes, creating immersive auditory experiences. Despite their potential applications in gaming, virtual reality, cinema, and assistive tools for the visually impaired, the adoption of these technologies has faced barriers. These include technical challenges, high implementation costs, limited public awareness, and the need for compatible hardware and software. This research will examine the current state of 3D audio, factors limiting its broader adoption, and opportunities to accelerate innovation, particularly in enhancing storytelling and accessibility.

The thesis aims to address these gaps by integrating acoustic technologies and sonic interfaces within artistic contexts. Procedural methods will be employed to synthesize room impulse responses based on interactive acoustic parameters. Through this exploration, the thesis will evaluate the feasibility and artistic potential of using sonic interfaces as tools for creative expression.

To explore these social behaviours, the thesis will use a questionnaire after presenting sound art created with the technologies mentioned before. This will help reveal how these technologies are perceived, any barriers or biases to their adoption, and the overall acceptance of these immersive audio technologies.
