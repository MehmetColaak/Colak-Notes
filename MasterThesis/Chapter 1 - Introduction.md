Virtual environments as narrative spaces, represents a novel way to tell a story or convey a specific feeling to the audience. Unlike traditional storytelling methods that rely on delivering story through dialogue, cutscenes or text dumps; environmental storytelling operates more subtly.

To effectively highlight environmental storytelling, itâ€™s crucial to weave narrative elements seamlessly into the virtual environment that evoke emotions and encourage players to question their surroundings. The very design of virtual spaces like their size, shape, flow, connectivity and materials can convey narrative meaning. The layout of virtual environment can guide the player along a specific path, revealing information sequentially or create feelings of safety, exposure or confusion. The environment becomes a silent narrator, communicating with audience through carefully crafted, immovable details that enhance immersion and improve the narrative experience[[References#Environmental Storytelling Blogpost |1]].

Due to interactive, exploratory and emergent capabilities of video games in storytelling, environmental storytelling practiced more often especially after video game industry's increased popularity[[References#Unravelling the complexity of the Video Game Industry An integrative framework and future research directions |2]]. While this practice increasing, the auditory domain of environmental storytelling remains understudied. This thesis focuses specifically on the auditory dimension of environmental storytelling practice.

Movies, video games and interactive art installations mostly utilizing different human sensory fields simultaneously. This multi-modality should be studied and researched while contributing these mediums as an artistic individual. 

 With this multi-sensory understanding, this research will further investigate the interplay/crossplay between auditory and tactile feedback within environmental storytelling. The aim is to explore how audio-tactile experiences can enhance immersion, evoke emotional responses and create richer, more embodied narrative contents for the audience.
## 1.1 Research Questions
The study addresses these following three fundamental questions about auditory environmental narration:
1. To what extent does multi-modality plays role in the environmental narration?
2. How multi-modal stimulation can be utilized to enhance auditory environmental narration?
3. How effectively can an interactive audio-tactile system convey distinct environmental characteristics (space size, material properties etc.) and narrative cues to an audience?
To begin this investigation, the next chapter will review existing literature on multi-modal interaction.
