## Game References
- Lucas Pope - Return of the Obra Dinn: Is a narrative puzzle game. The central mechanic revolves around the Memento Mortem, a mystical pocket watch that allows the investigator to witness the final moments of any corpse discovered aboard the ship. Activating the watch triggers a flashback, presenting the player with two key components: a static, frozen visual tableau of the death scene, which can be freely explored within certain spatial bounds, and a brief audio recording capturing the sounds and dialogue immediately preceding the death. The game demands close attention to dialogue, accents, specific sound effects, and environmental details to piece together the identities, causes of death, and perpetrators for each individual.
