# Chapter 2 - Background and Related Works to Embracing Sphere
This chapter establishes fundamental concepts related with Embracing Sphere by covering narratology, acoustics, haptics concepts. The chapter aims to investigate artworks and video games chosen for their relation to the Embracing Sphere on both conceptual and practical levels.
## 2.1 Environmental Narration
From the title of this thesis throughout the text, there is a distinctive decision on the terms of environmental narration rather than environmental storytelling. Despite more frequent usage of storytelling term with environmental storytelling, the decision to use environmental narration was intentional. The intention to raise important questions about the Embracing Sphere: is it a narration or a storytelling? To explain the difference, we must first explore narratology and its establishment in the literature.

Narratology is the study of narrative, aiming to understand its distinctive properties by analyzing its basic elements and differentiating storytelling from other modes of representation. It seeks to investigate what makes a text, discourse, film or other artifact a narrative and how narratives function[[References#Basic Elements of Narrative|1]].
