### Abstract
This paper presents a novel coupling of haptics technology and music, introducing the notion of tactile composition or aesthetic composition for the sense of touch. A system that facilitates the composition and perception of intricate, musically structured spatio-temporal patterns of vibration on the surface of the body is described.
### Introduction
	Sentences that impressive:
- Sometimes we even refer to music as being ‘tac- tile,’ usually in reference to its sonic texture or timbre.
- Why not take these metaphors a step further to actually materialize these visceral or tactile elements of music?
- Vibrotactile stimuli are viewed not as signals carrying information per say, but as aesthetic artifacts themselves.
- Because sound is essentially vibration, the well-established field of music provides an abundance of analogies, technical guidelines, and inspiration for the newborn field of tactile composition as presented.
- The skin is more remarkable and versatile than most of us know, capable of fine spatial and temporal analysis.
This article views haptic technologies (in particular the vibrotactile stimulator) as independent output devices to be used in conjunction with the composition and perception of music.
### Previous Work and Related Research
From the early days of the color organ to the more recent phenomena of video mixing and digital music visualization software, the coupling of music and visual media has been explored in considerable depth. This field has seen significant leaps with improvements in display technology, a trend that will surely manifest itself in tactile composition.

The entertainment industry has seen various attempts at integrating the sense of touch with visual and audio media. One example is the puffs of compressed air against the ankles or necks of unsuspecting audience members found in theme park movie rides.

It is increasingly common to encounter vibrotactile feedback in video-game controllers.
### System Design
At the heart of the system is a full-body vibro- tactile stimulator comprised of thirteen transducers worn against the body. In this section, several key factors in the design process are discussed.
#### Why Vibrotactile?
A number of tactile stimulation devices are available, each of which stimulates a specific tactile response. These include pressure, thermal, slip, electrocutaneous, and vibrational displays. The vibrotactile modality was chosen for two reasons. First, vibration devices are generally easiest to work with and in particular, to control. Second, the bandwidth of the skin’s vibrotactile response coincides most closely with that of music.

Transducers have a coil-based design and can thus be driven with any waveform in the tactile frequency range. They produce very clean, localized vibrations, have a relatively high power output, and exhibit a frequency response that peaks at 250 Hz.
