### Abstract
This paper presents a floor tile that uses vibrotactile actuators and force sensors to simulate the feeling of walking on different ground materials like gravel, carpet, or stone. The control software uses a model of foot-ground interaction, and a calibration method is prototyped to match real-world ground materials.
### Introduction
The idea for this device was inspired by the phenomenon of ground materials evoking strong memories, as illustrated by Marcel Proust's experience. The device aims to create the illusion of walking on various materials by delivering vibrotactile signals to the feet through a floor tile. It draws on physically based sound synthesis models and aims to offer a cost-effective alternative to other haptic locomotion interfaces.
### Identification of Ground Materials in Walking
The feet are well-suited for perceiving ground textures due to the high density of tactile mechanoreceptors on the soles. Research was conducted to study how people identify ground materials through tactile, proprioceptive, and auditory information.
### Device Design and Methodology
The device consists of a polycarbonate tile on foam, supported by a frame, with a linear motor actuator to produce vibrations and force sensing resistors to measure the force applied to the tile. The system uses a software simulation to generate audio signals that drive the actuator, creating vibrotactile and auditory stimuli. The control signal is derived from the change in force applied to the tile.
### Measurement of Ground Surfaces and Device Calibration
The parameters of the rendering algorithms can be tuned to approximate the feel of natural materials. A measurement apparatus was developed to record the interaction between a walker and ground materials, using a shoe equipped with force sensors, vibration transducers, and an accelerometer. This setup was used to record data from subjects walking on various materials.
### Model Parameter Identification: Aggregates
The identification of synthesis model parameters from the recorded data is ongoing. For aggregate materials, key parameters include modal frequencies, decay times, and the relationship between force and impact event rate. The PhISEM analysis method is used to infer the impact event rate from vibration data.
### Conclusions
The device raises questions about the nature of haptic interaction between the foot and ground surfaces. It presents a measurement-based approach to shaping the device's interactive behavior to match real-world ground materials.
