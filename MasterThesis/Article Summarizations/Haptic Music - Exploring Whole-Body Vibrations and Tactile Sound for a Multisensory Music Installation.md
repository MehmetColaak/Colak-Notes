### Introduction
This paper presents a study on the composition of haptic music for a multisensory installation and how composers could be aided by a preparatory workshop focusing on the perception of whole-body vibrations prior to such a composition task.
### Vibrotactile Perception
Different vibrotactile frequency response ranges for the skin have been reported. For example, 0.4 to 500Hz is suggested in (L. Kruger - Pain and Touch) while 20–1000Hz is reported in (Cutaneous Grooves: Composing for the Sense of Touch). A frequency of 250Hz is suggested for optimal sensing vibration frequency for touch (Cutaneous Grooves: Composing for the Sense of Touch). In the current work, the primary body parts in contact with the vibrating platform are the feet. The foot is one of the most sensitive parts of the body when it comes to vibrotactile stimulation and the sensory physiology of the foot sole is similar to that of the skin of the hand.
### Perception of Whole-Body Vibrations
Whole-body vibration occurs “when a human is supported by a surface that is shaking and the vibration affects body parts remote from the site of exposure” (N. J. Mansfield, Human Response to Vibration). 

Expo- sure limits and thresholds for vertical vibration, motion is most easily perceived at around 5Hz. For horizontal vibration, the corresponding value is found below 2Hz. Laboratory studies of discomfort have established a relationship between the magnitude, duration, frequency content, and waveform of the signal, but the interaction between these properties is not trivial and is confounded by inter- and intra-subject differences.
