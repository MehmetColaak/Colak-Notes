### Introduction
This research is exploring capabilities of human perception on perceiving harmonic tones as tactile stimuli. Specifically this research is important for my artwork to have previous scientific works and experimentation on provoking same feelings on multimodal stimuli environment. Research article aims to answer these 3 questions:

- Q1: Can we reliably evaluate the degree of consonance for vibrotactile chords?
- Q2: If the answer to Q1 is positive, does the frequency difference in a vibrotactile chord affect its degree of consonance in systematic manner?
- Q3: If the answers to Q1 and Q2 are both positive, can we find a measure that maps the physical parameters of a vibrotactile chord to its degree of consonance?

40 participants evaluated the degrees of consonance of the 80 vibrotactile chords in a 0-100 scale.
### Consonance - Dissonance
Perception of musical chords has been extensively stud- ied since the late 19th century. Established theories pertaining to consonance in sound include Helmholtz’s theory. Helmholtz argued that consonance and dissonance in sound are determined by the level of acoustic beating. Two simultaneously played sound waves interfere with each other and the human auditory system perceives them as a single combinational tone. When two pure tones are mixed, their frequency difference creates beats. In Helmholtz’s theory, if the beats between the frequency components are so intense that humans hear them as rough and unpleasant, then the chords are regarded as dissonant. 

There have been several attempts to describe auditory consonance with pairs of adjectives such as beautiful-ugly, euphonious-cacophonous, and pleasant-unpleasant. Smoothness was also frequently used to describe consonance. Studies showed that these adjectives can represent the degree of auditory consonance in consistent manner. Research's experimental results are compared later with these theories of auditory consonance.
### Perception of Vibrotactile Roughness
A large body of research pertaining to the vibrotactile perception of roughness has been carried out, motivated from research interests in the tactile perception of textures. 
### Methods
This section presents the methods used in our perceptual experiment carried out to answer our three research questions about vibrotactile consonance.

Forty participants (28 male and 12 female; 19 to 27 years old with an average 21.57; 38 right-handed, 1 left-handed, and 1 ambidextrous) participated in this experiment. Four had considerable experience of haptic devices, while the other 36 had little or none.
### Stimuli
All vibrotactile stimuli used in the experiment were 2 second long. They consisted of two frequency components. Their base frequency was one of 40, 55, 80, and 110 Hz. The frequency of 40 Hz was chosen as a root frequency. Its double, 80 Hz, is an analogy with musical octaves. The frequency 110 Hz is one of the tuning standards for musical pitch (A2) for low-pitched musical instruments, such as the contrabass and tuba.

The experiment consisted of nine sessions and each session was finished within 5 min. The first session was for training, and it presented 20 vibrotactile chords evenly sampled from the entire 80 chords. During this session, the participants were instructed to establish consistent criteria for assessing the degree of consonance of vibrotactile chords.

### Conclusion 
A well-defined functional relationship was observed between the degree of consonance and vibration frequencies, suggesting that vibrotactile consonance can be a good metric to represent the perceptual characteristics of superimposed vibrations. The beat frequency of the envelope of superimposed vibrations was shown highly relevant to consonance perception. The subjective impressions associated with vibrotactile consonance and dissonance were smooth vibrational feeling and rough, fluttering sensations, respectively. 

The experimentation also showed vibrotactile consonance perception is correlated to auditory consonance perception on the basis of the resemblance between their physical measures.
