The paper begins by addressing the growing interest in how humans respond to whole-body vibration, largely due to the increased use of vehicles like cars, trucks, and airplanes. This interest has spurred both fundamental research and comfort studies. These studies often employ reliable electrodynamic or hydraulic systems (simulators) in laboratory settings to generate vibrations in one (vertical, z) or three (x, y, z) directions. These systems are expected to have a linear-frequency response, no cross-talk between different axes, no system harmonics, and minimal noise to prevent sound-vibration interference. The core principles of authentic whole-body-vibration reproduction and simulation systems share similarities with binaural techniques and audio reproduction systems.

The text draws a comparison: when binaural recorded signals are played back through headphones, the transfer characteristic of the reproduction system must be compensated for, because this characteristic is influenced not only by the transducer but also by mounting conditions and individual ear properties. Similarly, whole-body vibration reproduction systems are affected by individual body properties like weight, body mass index, and adipose tissue. Fundamental scientific and comfort studies require that the same stimulus (amplitude and frequency) be presented to all subjects, necessitating individual equalization filters that account for the body properties of each subject and the system's specifications.

The paper then details the structure of an electrodynamic shaker, noting its similarity to a dynamic loudspeaker. This shaker has a coil suspended in a fixed radial magnetic field, and passing a current through the coil produces an axial force proportional to the current, which is then transmitted to a table where the test person is seated. The mechanical response is dominated by three vibration modes: at low frequencies, the isolation mounts allow the shaker to move as a rigid body; in the middle range (10 to 40 Hz), the suspension mode dominates; and at high frequencies, the table-person system exhibits resonances. The shaker and person are represented by a simplified resonance model, and it is noted that all electrodynamic exciters have similar transfer functions and acceleration-frequency characteristics due to the typical electro-mechanical properties of the materials used.

The "Investigations" section describes how body-related transfer functions (BRTFs) were measured for 40 subjects using an electro-dynamic excitation system capable of producing vertical vibrations in the 5 Hz to 1000 Hz range. The system used Artemis 8.0 software to generate excitation signals, an RME Hammerfall Multiface II soundcard, an Alesis RA 150 amplifier, and an electrodynamic shaker. The transfer function of the system was measured with white noise as the input vibration signal in the vertical direction from 4 to 500 Hz. A semi-rigid pad with a triaxial accelerometer was used to measure vibration at the body-seat interface, and HEAD Recorder software was used to record the data for the transfer functions. In addition to the BRTF measurements, anthropometric data of the subjects was collected.

The "Results" section provides details on the subjects' physical parameters, including weight (53 kg - 109 kg), adipose tissue (5% - 35%), Body-Mass-Index (18 - 30), and age (19 - 57). The body-related transfer functions of the 40 subjects were presented, showing the relationship between the amplifier input (V) and the vibration at the body-seat interface (m/sÂ²). The measurements revealed two resonance frequencies, one in the 100 Hz to 150 Hz range and another in the 180 Hz to 220 Hz range, resulting from table-person interaction. It was observed that an increase in the subject's weight leads to a decrease in resonance frequency, and adipose and BMI values influence the amplitude range of the transfer functions. The section also discusses the definition and creation of an average body transfer function, noting that while the Just Noticeable Difference thresholds for vertical whole-body-vibrations are about 1.5 dB, the amplitude differences between the maximum and minimum values of the BRTFs exceed these thresholds. This suggests that an average body transfer function is not suitable for fundamental research or comfort studies.

In conclusion, the study introduces Body Related Transfer Functions for whole-body vibration reproduction systems and emphasizes the importance of individual transfer functions for understanding whole-body vibration perception. The research explored the creation of an average body related transfer function and the influence of body properties on the transfer function characteristic. The findings indicate that the transfer characteristic is significantly dependent on individual body properties such as weight, body mass index, and adipose tissue, thus underscoring the necessity of considering individual transfer functions in whole-body vibration perception investigations.
