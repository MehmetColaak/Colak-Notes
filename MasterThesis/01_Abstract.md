# Abstract

**Example1:** Sound design with the goal of immersion is not new. However, sound design for immersive media experiences (IMEs) utilizing spatial audio can still be consid- ered a relatively new area of practice with less well-defined methods requiring a new and still emerging set of skills and tools. There is, at present, a lack of formal literature around the challenges introduced by this relatively new content form and the tools used to create it, and how these may differ from audio production for traditional media. This article, through the use of semi-structured interviews and an online questionnaire, looks to explore what audio practitioners view as defining features of IMEs, the challenges in creating audio content for IMEs and how current practices for traditional stereo productions are being adapted for use within 360 interactive soundfields. It also highlights potential direction for future research and technological development and the importance of practitioner involvement in research and development in ensuring future tools and technologies satisfy the current needs.

**Example2:** With the increasing interest in virtual reality games and the newly available options of binaural simulated sound (3D audio), the effects of spatialized audio on players has become of interest. This study focuses on the effect that 3D audio has on player's levels of immersion and presence through the use of questionnaires, phasic electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV). In this study participants played a game exposing them to different horrific auditory stimuli either rendered with stereo or 3D audio. Questionnaires showed no significant differences in level of immersion or presence, but a significant difference was observed for EDA responses. This could suggest that 3D audio induces a higher level of immersion or presence on a subconscious level compared to stereo, though a higher sound intensity was observed for 3D audio which could also explain the results.

**Example3:** In this practice-based case study, we investigate the subjective aesthetic and affective responses to a shift from 2D stereo-based modelling to 3D object-based Dolby Atmos in an audio installation artwork. Dolby Atmos is an infinite object-based audio format released in 2012 but only recently incorporated into more public-facing formats. Our analysis focuses on the artist Sadia Sadia’s 30-channel audio installation ‘Notes to an Unknown Lover’, based on her book of free verse poetry of the same title, which was rebuilt and reformatted in a Dolby Atmos specified studio. We examine what effect altered spatiality with an infinite number of ‘placements’ has on the psychoacoustic and neuroaesthetic response to the text. The effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) object-based audio is interrogated against more traditional stereo and two-dimensional (2D) formats regarding the expression and communication of emotion and what effect altered spatiality with an infinite number of placements has on the psychoacoustic and neuroaesthetic response to the text. We provide a unique examination of the consequences of a shift from 2D to wholly encompassing object-based audio in a text-based artist’s audio installation work. These findings may also have promising applications for health and well-being issues.
