An interactive narrative ofers a pre-specifed level of story agency or choice to the audience, allowing them to exert an infuence on the plot. Te interactive experience is ‘highly context-dependent’ and involves some form of interface such as text input (entered at the command line), a hand-held controller or a gesture-sensing device (Laurel, 1991 p. 21)

THE LOOP: IF, THEN, GOTO Manovich identifed the ‘loop’ as a new narrative form appropriate to the computer age. Basic computer programming languages use loops to perform the repetitive routines on data arrays. ‘IF/THEN’ and ‘GOTO’ statements manipulate the control fow of program code to execute runtime instructions as a non-linear sequence. Te loop is also extensively employed in cell animation. Walking characters are achieved through a series of repeating cells. Tis technique was also employed by the flmmaker Zbigniew Rybczyński in his flm Tango (1982). Rybczynski ‘loops’ live action footage to move repeating characters through a fxed spatial location. Te characters are placed so skilfully that they never occupy the same spatial or temporal space. While we can view the loops as repeating information, their juxtaposition with other narrative elements allow the audience to create a new version of reality with each iteration. Te screen is at one stage so overcrowded that it seems impossible that the flm-maker could be working with a fxed area of focus, a fxed point on the screen where he expects his audience to be looking. In other words, the author has created the work and then given authorial control to the audience to establish their own perspective on the story.

spatial audio rendering through headphones involves the computation of binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) to capture/render sound sources in space (see Fig.1.2). BRIRs can be separated into two distinct components: the room impulse response (RIR), which defnes room acoustic properties, and the head-related impulse response (HRIR) or head-related transfer function (HRTF, i.e. , the HRIR in the frequency domain), which acoustically describes the individual contributions of the listener’s head, pinna, torso, and shoulders

The reverberation time, T60, is the time taken by the reverberant energy to decay by 60 dB. Since the reverberation contains numerous, lengthy paths through the scene, it provides a sense of the overall scene, such as its size. The T60 is frequencydependent; the relative decay rate across various frequencies informs the listener about the acoustic materials in a scene and atmospheric absorption.

Results from different experiments are reviewed showing that the auditory and somatosensory channels together can produce constructive effects resulting in measurable perceptual enhancement.

Similar observations have been made on behavioral level: sounds and vibrations have been shown to interact constructively when congruent stimuli are delivered simultaneously [56, 57], with measurable auditory effects of somatosensory feedback [4, 36, 37, 39, 51, 52, 61]. Here congruence is defned depending on the experimental procedure: in general, it refers to conditions in which the multisensory stimulus shares common spatio-temporal as well as spectral features

Here congruence is defned depending on the experimental procedure: in general, it refers to conditions in which the multisensory stimulus shares common spatio-temporal as well as spectral features, as if it was originating from a unique source producing sounds and vibrations together

Two experiments [13] studied the role of impact sounds and vibrations for the subjective classifcation of three fat objects, which were respectively made of wood, plastic, and metal

Importantly for this chapter, the ability of our subjects to maximize their identifcation accuracy when using sounds and vibrations together suggests that audio-tactile summation may work in all individuals as soon as they have acquired a solid knowledge about a multisensory event belonging to the everyday experience, and not only if they have accumulated peculiar audio-tactile skills, e.g., by practicing for a long time with a musical instrument.
