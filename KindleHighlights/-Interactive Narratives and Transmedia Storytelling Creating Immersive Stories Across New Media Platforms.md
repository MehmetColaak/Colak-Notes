# Interactive Narratives and Transmedia Storytelling Creating Immersive Stories Across New Media Platforms
## Metadata


## Highlights
An interactive narrative ofers a pre-specifed level of story agency or choice to the audience, allowing them to exert an infuence on the plot. Te interactive experience is ‘highly context-dependent’ and involves some form of interface such as text input (entered at the command line), a hand-held controller or a gesture-sensing device (Laurel, 1991 p. 21) — location: []() ^ref-1080

---
Te mode of interaction is blended to the narrative to function as a natural method of ‘reading’ the story, ‘all representations are conventional in the sense that they depend upon symbol systems that might, in principle, be replaced by some other system’ (Mitchell, 1995 p. 351) — location: []() ^ref-34871

---
Te reality created by a narrative is an interpretation of the facts presented to us. — location: []() ^ref-16159

Walter Murch described editing as ‘cutting – the sudden disruption of reality’ (Murch, 2001 p. 16) — location: []() ^ref-60482

---
We can move temporally, focusing on the moments that are most signifcant. Slow — location: []() ^ref-22811

---
Slow motion allows the viewer to go beyond ‘real-time’ and watch a ‘hyper-real’ version of a shot — location: []() ^ref-57388

---
Murch reiterates Eisenstein’s theory of montage and considers how our right and left eyes view a scene from two slightly diferent perspectives. Tese alternate felds of vision are very similar yet diferent — location: []() ^ref-1946

An incoherent visual sequence creates an uneasy atmosphere — location: []() ^ref-44900

He describes speech as ‘encoded sound’ where ‘the listener must decode it using linguistic tools to associate meaning’ (Murch quoted in Koppelman, 2004 p. 288). Music is ‘embodied sound’ which ‘requires no code for understanding’. It can be experienced directly without analysis. In between speech and music are sound efects which are half language, half music. Murch wrote in a 1998 article Dense Clarity, Clear Density: — location: []() ^ref-23117

Te spectator is making calculations on the narrative arc trajectory based on previous flms, stories, narrative conventions etc. — location: []() ^ref-27410

---
Te audio does not have to be real — location: []() ^ref-42948

---
Te audience is not a passive observer, but actively investigates the frame both spatially and temporally, responding to the tension created within the narrative space — location: []() ^ref-22921

ENTGRENZUNG: THE DISSOLUTION OF PERSPECTIVAL BOUNDARIES James Joyce employed the strategy of Entgrenzung, or dissolution of boundaries, to bring separate experiences together. Te stream of consciousness technique allows the reader to view the internal and external with reality being dependent on the point of view of the observer. Te audience is encouraged to create new realities — location: []() ^ref-63670

THE LOOP: IF, THEN, GOTO Manovich identifed the ‘loop’ as a new narrative form appropriate to the computer age. Basic computer programming languages use loops to perform the repetitive routines on data arrays. ‘IF/THEN’ and ‘GOTO’ statements manipulate the control fow of program code to execute runtime instructions as a non-linear sequence. Te loop is also extensively employed in cell animation. Walking characters are achieved through a series of repeating cells. Tis technique was also employed by the flmmaker Zbigniew Rybczyński in his flm Tango (1982). Rybczynski ‘loops’ live action footage to move repeating characters through a fxed spatial location. Te characters are placed so skilfully that they never occupy the same spatial or temporal space. While we can view the loops as repeating information, their juxtaposition with other narrative elements allow the audience to create a new version of reality with each iteration. Te screen is at one stage so overcrowded that it seems impossible that the flm-maker could be working with a fxed area of focus, a fxed point on the screen where he expects his audience to be looking. In other words, the author has created the work and then given authorial control to the audience to establish their own perspective on the story. — location: []() ^ref-62166

Jon Dovey states that a successful interactive narrative works on both the spatial axis and temporal axis (Dovey quoted in Rieser & Zapp, 2002 p. 138) — location: []() ^ref-19321

Our visual perception is limited to what is before our gaze, whereas hearing is ‘omnidirectional’ and thus fundamental to achieving a sense of presence (Collins et al, 2014 p.215) — location: []() ^ref-35180

In Dunkirk (2017) Hans Zimmer used an audio illusion called the Shepard tone to create a ticking score, a ‘continuing ascension of tone … a corkscrew efect’ which both increased the intensity and complemented the mathematical complexity of three interweaving narratives (Guerrasio, 2017). — location: []() ^ref-36331

Spatialised sound and auditory cues positively infuence the sense of presence and immersion within a narrative (Collins et al, 2014 p. 223). — location: []() ^ref-29207
