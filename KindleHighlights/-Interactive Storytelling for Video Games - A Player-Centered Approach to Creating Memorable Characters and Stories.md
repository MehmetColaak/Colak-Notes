# Interactive Storytelling for Video Games - A Player-Centered Approach to Creating Memorable Characters and Stories
## Metadata


## Highlights
Unlike books and film, which can be considered mature forms of media, video games are relatively new, with the first arcade machines appearing in the early 1970s, and are still growing and evolving in nearly every way — location: []() ^ref-33956

But gaming hardware isn’t the only thing that’s changing. Games themselves are evolving as well, with new control schemes, gameplay elements, and genres appearing on a regular basis. Like all other aspects of video games, their stories are in a state of change as well. Game stories have evolved from the simple kidnapped-girl plot of Donkey Kong to the complex novel-length tales of modern RPGs. In addition, the ability of the player to interact with and affect the story has created many new and different types of stories that are difficult if not impossible to portray in other kinds of media. — location: []() ^ref-41386
