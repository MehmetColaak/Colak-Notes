AI talking about climate change
I as a human found it inappropriate to ai to talk about climate change
I would make an ad hominem to Taylor Swift if she would say something about climate change
Practicing ad hominem to ai is pointless but yet it makes me angry
What if the idea is belong to metaknowledge and big data where are we going to point our stick and make ad hominem.
