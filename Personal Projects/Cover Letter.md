Dear iRacing HR Department,

I am applying for the Technical Sound Designer position at iRacing. My background combines technical audio design, interactive systems, and hands-on experience with simulation-based immersive audio, directly aligning with the needs of this role.

I recently completed my Master’s degree in Interface Cultures at the University of Art and Design Linz, a multidisciplinary program focused on interactive media systems. My academic and practical focus areas include spatial audio, multichannel sound design, XR, and real-time interactive audio systems.

I have strong experience in technical sound design, including sound synthesis, sonic modeling, multichannel mixing, and spatial audio workflows. I work comfortably with DAWs, audio middleware, and real-time environments, and I have designed interactive audio systems for XR projects, immersive installations, and commercial applications.

I am also an active sim racing enthusiast with a strong interest in engine behavior and interactive vehicle sound design. My Master’s thesis project, Embracing Sphere, was an immersive auditory storytelling system built on a sim rig using bass shakers and haptic feedback generated by a neural network. The project explored how sound and vibration can enhance realism, perception, and immersion in simulated environments.

In addition to academic work, I have contributed to commercial and large-scale projects, including interactive installations for Artechouse and audio-interactive systems for an electric vehicle manufacturer in Turkey, TOGG. These projects required close collaboration with technical teams and reliable implementation in production environments.

I may require U.S. work authorization, including for remote work, and I am happy to discuss this if needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my technical audio background can contribute to iRacing.

Best regards,  
Mehmet Colak
