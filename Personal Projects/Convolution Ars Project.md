Embracing Sphere is an audio-tactile experience,
a glimpse from the vast unknown places at Tannh√§user Gate,
a novel way to convey a story embedded within environment itself.

Through the interplay of spatialized sound and haptic feedback, Embracing Sphere aims to provoke the audience to perceive and interpret a story purely through hearing and feeling the simulated environment.
