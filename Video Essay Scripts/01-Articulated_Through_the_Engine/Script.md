## Title
**An Extraordinary Instrument From the Streets**  
_Articulated Through the Engine_
## Intro
### Summary
This section will establish the subject with 2-3 sentences and introduce the premise of the video essay.
#### Video Edit Draft
Fast cuts of engine revs initiating the video stops imminently for the narration. After Intro script narrated a collage pad sound of granulated arabesque music pieces starts and we are going to the Background section.
### Main Text
This video is about something that caught my attention recently. Like every item, tool or object we obtain, and used through the time we people used them in many functions. Sometimes unintended ways. Detecting one of these unintentionally used tools is both surprising and uprising for my taste.

The tool I am talking about is... The combustion engine.
## Background
### Summary
This section is exist to pitch my background motivation to make this video. It will cover my simplified story on how I met with this phenomenon and as an enthusiastic sound designer how it fascinated me.
### Main Text
I am not an historian but I don't think anybody needs to be a historian to understand the importance of industrial revolution effect on our society. Engines made our life faster, easier, LOUDER... With industrial revolution humanities voice evolved. Tools that we express our voice has changed. The materials used to made out of wood and it became to be constructed with materials like brass, aluminium. Music has changed. Nonetheless preceding voices didn't die, sometimes it collaborated with new voices or new voices opened new doors for old voices to be expressed. Time is one directional dimension but the aesthetics around it is not.

Not too later to this timeline digitalization hit to the scene. All the knowhow of humanity started to reshape itself to document its existence in bytes. This concept also effected our perception of many things. Slowly but surely everything evolved.

I know we started rusty but personally I always need such background to truly grasp the concepts that I witnessed.

So what I witnessed you may ask?
THIS.
## Examples
### Summary
This section is going to show in depth real world examples. Will notice how the drivers incorporate music with engine articulation. It will explain what caught my attention on their movements, pedal actions, upshifts-downshifts.
### Main Text
Cars and the culture around it always fascinated me in a way that I have been constantly observing many different aspects of it. Pimping the cars with huge sound systems and driving through neighborhood. Eventually disturbing people that doesn't give a single fuck about your music taste or the music you affected emotionally.

In very basic sense we can resemble those car drivers to DJ's but I want to go a little bit further. They are extraordinary musicians. Their instruments are their car and the stage is the asphalt.

This practice I am going to name as playing an engine incorporates many small nuances and patterns that deserves a deeper research about it, At least in my interest. Who can stop me? 

Lets take a closer look at this expressive practice.
## Form Analysis
### Summary
This section will detail the driver movement and actions incorporated with the music form. Such as downshifting right before chorus start and engine cutting noise to enhance the excitement before chorus start just like a dj looping a snare hit or fill increased subdivisions every bar or after chorus start transmission upshifts done only on the 1st downbeat of the bar.
### Main Text
An internal combustion engine typically sounds like a rising and falling pitch tone due to faster and slower ignition events happened in the piston chambers. This changing pitch tone also affected by transmission because clutch mechanism separates the engine's crankshaft from the transmission and effecting the pitch of the sound with quick dips. Because typically lifting the foot off the accelerator, the engine’s RPM naturally begins to drop toward its idle speed.

There are some phrases or let's say stingers I observe in the engine play vocabulary.

**RPM Rise:** This may resemble a Crescendo or one-to-one purpose translated a "riser". In my perception it creates an anticipation, an excitement with some cognitive questions about where it is going to stop. Because you already know the direction. The feeling is familiar you are on a aural platform that goes up, up and up.

**RPM Fall:** Similar to the rpm rise resemblance to the Crescendo we can easily label this as Decrescendo in musical vocabulary of engine play.

**Gear Shift:** This is one of the few rhythmic elements of this instrument. Every gear change means clutch separated from the crankshaft, and throttle is off from the engine so slight RPM dip and eventually rise or fall according to throttle movement. This sounds like stingers that perceived as edges of musical phrases.

**Rev Limiter:** In my taste this is most expressive sound bit of an engine that also felt like a rhythmic element. The limiter prevents to go faster above certain speed of revolutions and it sound like this screechy, stuttering motion.

Alongside this small motions I think there are more composite moves in the vocabulary such as 
## Transformation of the Practice
### Summary
This section will cover how other people reshape this practice on different mediums and platforms while preserving the essence. I will show examples of 2nd most watched videos of the song that has been used in this practice most of the time, racing video game footages that doing this engine articulation practice with the song. And people who likes this expression start to mimic the sound of the engine with their mouth and posting on social media, their engine articulation performances.

## Last Notes and Outro
### Summary
This section I will genuinely express how it amazes me that this practice become a phenomenon and many people grasp it and re-perform it on many different songs, platforms with their own way. And it will close with last words, thanking if people watch it through the end.
